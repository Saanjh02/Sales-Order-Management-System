# Sales-Order-Management-System

**#PROJECT OVERVIEW:**

**Project Title**: **Sales & Order Management System **

**Level:** **Beginner And Intermediate **

**Database**:**'Sales_db'**

A mini SQL-based project that simulates a retail company's customer orders, product inventory, and employee activity tracking using relational database concepts.Built using Microsoft SQL Server.This project is a relational database system built for managing customers, employees, products, and orders. It supports querying various insights like revenue reports, customer behavior, and employee performance using SQL.

**#Objectives:**

- Design a normalized relational database for sales management.
- Populate the database with sample realistic data.
- Run intermediate-level SQL queries to extract business insights.
- Practice joins, aggregations, subqueries, and groupings.
- Support future integration with front-end or BI tools.
  
**#Project Structure:**

**Database Creation:** Created a database named Sales_db.

**Table Creation:** Created tables for Customers, Employees, Orders, OrderDetails and Products. Each table includes relevant columns and relationships.

```sql

-- 1. Customers Table
DROP TABLE IF EXISTS Customers
CREATE TABLE Customers (
						CustomerID INT PRIMARY KEY,
						 Name VARCHAR(100),
						Email VARCHAR(100),
						Phone VARCHAR(15),
						City VARCHAR(50)
						);

-- 2. Employees Table
DROP TABLE IF EXISTS Employees 
CREATE TABLE Employees (
						EmployeeID INT PRIMARY KEY,
						Name VARCHAR(100),
						Position VARCHAR(50),
						Department VARCHAR(50)
						);

-- 3. Products Table
DROP TABLE IF EXISTS Products
CREATE TABLE Products (
						ProductID INT PRIMARY KEY,
						Name VARCHAR(100),
						Category VARCHAR(50),
						Price DECIMAL(10, 2),
						Stock INT
						);

-- 4. Orders Table
DROP TABLE IF EXISTS Orders 
CREATE TABLE Orders (
						OrderID INT PRIMARY KEY,
						CustomerID INT,
						EmployeeID INT,
						OrderDate DATE,
						FOREIGN KEY (CustomerID) REFERENCES Customers(CustomerID),
						FOREIGN KEY (EmployeeID) REFERENCES Employees(EmployeeID)
					);

-- 5. OrderDetails Table
DROP TABLE IF EXISTS OrderDetails
CREATE TABLE OrderDetails (
							OrderDetailID INT PRIMARY KEY,
							OrderID INT,
							ProductID INT,
							Quantity INT,
							Discount DECIMAL(4, 2),
							FOREIGN KEY (OrderID) REFERENCES Orders(OrderID),
							FOREIGN KEY (ProductID) REFERENCES Products(ProductID)
						);


```


**#CRUD Operations:**

**Create**: Insert new customers, products, or orders
**Read**: Retrieve customer info, order history, revenue reports
**Update**: Modify product prices or customer contact details
**Delete**: Remove specific orders or out-of-stock products

## ‚úÖ Conclusion

This Sales and Order Management SQL project helped demonstrate the design and execution of a relational database system. Using SQL Server, we created tables, populated them with realistic sample data, and extracted valuable insights using intermediate-level queries.

Through this project, we practiced:

- Database schema design and normalization
- Writing SQL queries involving joins, groupings, and aggregations
- Generating business reports from raw data
- Performing CRUD operations for data manipulation

This project lays the foundation for future enhancements like front-end integration, report automation, or connecting to Power BI dashboards.


## How to Use

1. **Clone the Repository**: Clone this repository to your local machine.
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/Deepak Sharma/Sales & Order Management System.git
   ```

2. **Set Up the Database**: Execute the SQL scripts in the `database_setup.sql` file to create and populate the database.
3. **Run the Queries**: Use the SQL queries in the `analysis_queries.sql` file to perform the analysis.
4. **Explore and Modify**: Customize the queries as needed to explore different aspects of the data or answer additional questions.
